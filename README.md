# CitySim

## Goal:
Build a simple city simulation app where users manage limited space and resources by constructing buildings. The goal is to balance population, happiness, and income.

Core Stats:
- Population – comes from residential buildings.
- Happiness (0–100) – affected by parks and industrial buildings.
- Money – earned from industries, spent to build.
- Available Space (e.g. 20 tiles) – limits what can be built.

## Gameplay Actions (features):
- Show city stats: population, happiness, money, space used.
- Show available buildings and their effects.
- Allow building by clicking a button (space and money permitting).
- Show current buildings and allow removing (optional).
